Through the past 20 years drugs have been an ever present issue in the city of San Francisco. Analyzing the public record of police data from the years 2003-2018 we can uncover some of the trends in the different types of drugs involved. 

The police data we looked at is available online at <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data" target="_blank"> data.sfgov.org </a>, it includes every crime incident from January 2003 till May 2018. For each crime it includes information such as the time, type, district and coordinates.

Selecting DRUG/NARCOTIC category and sorting them by involved drugs, e.g. 'POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA', 'SALE OF MARIJUANA', 'POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA FOR SALES', 'TRANSPORTATION OF MARIJUANA','FURNISHING MARIJUANA' categories will all appear under a name **Marijuana** in our plots. 

We created a time-series Bokeh plot showing our selected drug types and normalised crime count from 2003 to 2017:
