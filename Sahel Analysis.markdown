<h2> Overview of Terror Attacks in Central Sahel Africa </h2>

## Intro
Initial work was to look for currently highly affected regions by terrorism using stats like global terrorism index[2] or our and map plots we understood that Central Sahel Africa  is currently one of the most terrorism affeted regions in the whole world. 
This region is interesting with Islamic extremism uprising in the last decade and major islamic terrorist powers taking advantage of the poor and remote regions of south-sahara, with boko haram, ISGS (Islamic State in Greater Sahara) had been or are activiely affiliated with Islamic state, as well as Jamaâ€™at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimim(JNIM) affiliated with al-qaeida and with governements failing to provide security and power to defeat these groups, terror and fear has taken regions economy in time of uncertainty.

### What is the Sahel region of Africa?
The Central Sahel is a region in West Africa comprised of the countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.Political violence is a major issue in each of these countries and they have all been subject to [1] 
Notably leaders of these countries are not even visiting the more remote northern regions of the countries due to lack of control and security there, the ongoing clashes between violent groups and citizens keep causing chaos. Motives for these groups vary, some have feudal territorial claims, fight for political power, gain and control over smuggling routes for human and drug trafficking over sahara. In 2017 UN passed a bill for global powers to intervene and help combat terrorism in the region.[3] France has greatly contributed with it's military powers, Sahel region has been largest Frances offshores active military operation. 

### Global Terrorism Database
It is understandable to argue that the GTD is currently the only database with comprehensive covereage of  global and domestic terrorism.

Terrorism definition by the UN that as a minimum terrorism is "Terrorism involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages." [5]

It is important to seperate government oppression, war crimes, genocides, guerilla warfare from this set as although they can be far worse, these events do not fall into the category of the definition.

### Lack of coverage 
When looking at central Sahel region and important note is that some of attacks, especially attacks dating prior 2010 go unnoticed and do not get reported due to local issues, lack of media coverage and the threat that is posed on getting exposed when reporting events such as terrorist attacks. Media outlets in west africa are fewer and poorly funded with certain report bias e.g. of attacks with governmental or political motives in the region getting sponsorerd or tolerated by the local authorities. [4]

## Terror Groups
As modern world has set more focus in combating the Islamic extremists and global Jihad, reporting of attacks greatly imporoved with groups such as Boko Haram had revceived greater notice due to it's islamic attakcs on Nigerian government and dominantly Christian society as  [5]

### What are the major terror organisations involved?
Through looking at the GTD we found that the most prevalent terrorism organisations were:

<object type="text/html" data="{{ site.baseurl }}/GroupCountBar.html"  width="1200" height="900" style="border: none; padding: 0; width:100%; height:30vw"></object>

1. **Unknown:** The largest group shown on the plot is, by far, the incidents where the affiliated group is unknown. This means while recording the incident it was unclear which group was behind the attack and no group claimed responsibility.
2. **JNIM:** Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, formed in March of 2017 when the four groups Ansar al-Din, al-Murabitun, the Macina Liberation Front (MLF), and the Sahara Emirate subgroup of al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) merged together. The leader has pledged allegiance to the emirs of AQIM, al-Qa'ida and the Taliban. This group is based in Mali but has attacked all across the Sahel region. [6]
3. **Muslim Extremists:** An umbrella term where the incident was likely committed by one of the other islamic groups mentioned here.
4. **Boko Haram:** Refer to themselves as Jama'atu Ahl as-Sunnah li-Da'awati wal-Jihad (translates to "People Committed to the Prophet's Teachings for Propagation and Jihad") was founded in 2002 in Nigeria. In July 2010 the previous second-in-command took control, threatened western influence in Nigeria and pledged allegiance to al-Qa'ida. Capability and activities increased greatly in 2014. [7]
5. **Other:** The groups which were not in the top 14 most active were labelled "Other". Together these make up the fifth largest group. The three largest organisation in it were Fulani extremists, Al-Mua'qi'oon Biddam Brigade (Those who Sign with Blood) and the Movement of Niger People for Justice (MNJ) with 11, 10 and 9 attacks respectively.
6. **ISGS:** The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, formed from a division from the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) group. Leader pledged allegiance to ISIS in May of 2015 but this was recognised only in October of 2016. Started out more active in western Niger and the Menaka region in Mali, but has since also been attacking in northern Burkina Faso. [8]
7. **AQIM:** Al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb mainly based in Algeria was originally founded in 1998 as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) but was renamed after joining al-Qa'ida in September of 2006. In 2012 the group, working with local Tuareg national elements, took control of some cities in northern Mali. They were fought back by the French military intervention in 2013 and lost the territory as well as some important members. They have been regrouping since 2015 and have had several attacks on United Nations forces present in the region. [9]
8. **Ansar al-Dine (Mali):** Formed from the aforementioned AQIM group in November of 2011 to establish an Islamic State in Mali. After the 2012 coup of Mali the group seized control over territory in the north, they were then fought back by the French intervention but re-emerged in 2016 and merged with three other groups to form JNIM in 2017. [10]
9. **MUJAO:** Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, split from AQIM in October 2011. More focused on the Sahel region than AQIM. Split in 2015 and part of the members later join either ISGS or JNIM.

*explain that the unknown means attacks which were not attributed to any group

### Where are the different groups most prevalent?
We plotted all terrorism incidents from 1970 until 2020 for Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Each point is sized by the number of deaths and colored by the affiliated terror organisation. Hovering over a point shows more details on that attack. Clicking once on a terror group in the legend will hide/unhide it from the map, while double clicking will isolate only this group.

<object type="text/html" data="{{ site.baseurl }}/MapPlot2.html"  width="1200" height="900" style="border: none; padding: 0; width:100%; height:30vw"></object>

We notice how the majority of attacks are roughly concentrated to the bordering region that is northern Burkina Faso and southern Mali as well as some in western Niger. The "Unknown" and "Muslim Extremist" attacks are especially concentrated to this area. We see for JNIM how some attacks follow along settlements by the Niger river in Mali, such as through the cities of Timbuktu and Gao. All but three of Boko Haram's attacks were in Niger, and the majority are very concentrated to the eastern border with Nigeria around Lake Chad as well as some more towards the border with Burkina Faso in the west. ISGS attacks are found almost exclusively along the southern border of Mali.

### What are the differences in terms of attack/target/weapon types between the groups?

For each group we found what share of their incidents are in the different categories of attack, target and weapon types. Below click to show graph for the different types, hover on the bars to see what share that category constitutes.

## Counter Terrorism
*What have been the major counter terrorism movements or governments involved?
Since Sahel lacks strong and stable politics and governance counter-terrorism operations have greatly struggled to initiate a strong counter-terrorism policy, corruption and lack of power in rural threaten stability. Extremist groups take advantage of this mismanagement and cause disruption in the government. Sahel also holds significant natural resource wealth, making it one of Africa's most affluent areas in terms of natural assets. Placing region in the centre of attention in a global scale. With Russia, France and USA beeing largest military conrtinbutors to the region. 
Local military police are very often involved in attacks and to this day from 2010-2020 there have been reportet xx causalties from military deaths. 
* G5 Joint Task Force 
In 2014 a group of 5 Sahel region countries comprised of five member countres: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania. Created to provide the institutional and enforcement structure to provide security within. In support of local governmen as well as cooperate and exchange criminal and ectremism information globally.  [6]

* France 
There are several groups involved in combating the regime with each having their own underlying reasons and motives, french government has had an on and off military pressence in sahel since 19th century as of today France wants to publilcly show their alligiency to democratic uprising in the region as well as defend their assets such as oil fields owned by total and uranium mines.
    Frances involvment is not particularly taken well by the local authorities and recent regime changes has had a significantly impacted public opinion of french government 
* USA 
Data up till 2020 shows that United States had contributed 6 billion Usd in military aid in the region. Although us physical military footprint has remained small. It's pressence with training programms and other assistance have been noticable. They have also developed TSCTP (The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership) as a multi year partnership to combat terrorism and strenghten security of the region.
